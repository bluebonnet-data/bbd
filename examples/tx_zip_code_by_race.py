"""Instructions for use

1) Make sure python is installed

2) Install the cloud_storage data package by running this command in your terminal:
    pip install bbd

3) Run this python file with the following command:
   (from your terminal in the same folder as this file):
    python tx_zip_code_by_race.py

4) Wait patiently... the first time this runs it has to download about 800 Mb of
us zip code shapefiles :/ but don't worry -- it caches them, so the next time it will
run much much faster.

5) Ta da, there should be a few exported data files.
    - data_for_team.csv -- the data you requested, can copy and paste into a spreadsheet
    - tx-zcta-map-B02001_00?E.html -- map of each demographic percentage. Open in web browser.
